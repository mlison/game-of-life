# Conway's game of life seeded by JS equality table

Well, the title says it all. This is a Javascript implementation of Conway's game of life that is seeded by equality table of various javascript values. The game uses real values and loose comparison.

Hover over a cell to see what comparison it represents. You can also interact with cells by clicking on them.

There's also a live demo <a href="https://mlison.github.io/game-of-life/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<sub>The implementation is a bit sub-optimal, since that wasn't the point of the exercise.</sub>
